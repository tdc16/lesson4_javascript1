### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Markdown is how you style the text used on your website. For example, if you want to bold a word, add ** before and after the selected text. To italicize, just use one * on both sides of the text.
2. To create a table on your website, you can divide the cells with hyphens ( - ) to make rows, and pipes ( | ) to create columns. 
3. Markdown and Github combine javascript code with elements of HTML and CSS code. They have something called code fencing which displays unique code and formatting based off the user's input.
